# Relativism

Probabilistic music creation

## What is it?

Relativism is a project to edit, analyze,
and synthesize music. 


## How does it work?

Because the audio is
typically stored at sample rates 44,000
samples per second, in stereo, editing
of a full song requires millions of data
points. To make this a usable program, nearly
all operations have been vectorized
with NumPy.
